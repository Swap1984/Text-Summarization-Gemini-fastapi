    "# Lets work with Summarisation app with Fast API\n",
    "Summarisation is the process of condensing a longer text into a shorter version that preserves the key ideas and intent. There are two main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "Extractive: selects important sentences/phrases from the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstractive: generates new text that paraphrases the original (what Gemini does).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Points to be considered to maintain high quality with summarisation output\n",
    "1. Preprocess input (clean, remove noise, handle very long text).\n",
    "2. Decide summarization type (extractive vs abstractive).\n",
    "3. Build a prompt or model pipeline.\n",
    "4. Generate summary.\n",
    "5. Post-process (trim, check length, ensure clarity).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Some Key factors while executing summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Length control: set word/token limits, or instruct max words.\n",
    "2. Fidelity: ensure summary doesn’t add facts not in the source.\n",
    "3. Coverage: capture all major points, not just the first paragraphs.\n",
    "4. Style: concise, bullet points, executive, etc.\n",
    "4. Input size: LLMs have context limits; long text may need chunking.\n",
    "5. Repetition: avoid repeating the same point in the summary.\n",
    "6. Latency and cost: larger inputs and outputs cost more and are slower.\n",
    "7. Error handling: handle empty input or model failures gracefully."
